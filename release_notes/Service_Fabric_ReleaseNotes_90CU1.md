## Current Breaking Changes

* **Guest Executable and Container Applications**: Guest executable and container applications created or upgraded in Service Fabric clusters with runtime versions 7.1+ are incompatible with prior Service Fabric runtime versions (e.g. Service Fabric 7.0).<br/>
    Following scenarios are impacted:<br/>
    * An application with guest executables or containers is created or upgraded in a Service Fabric 7.1+ cluster.<br/>
    The cluster is then downgraded to a previous Service Fabric runtime version (e.g. Service Fabric 7.0).<br/>
    The application fails to activate.<br/>
    * A cluster upgrade from a version prior to Service Fabric v7.1 to Service Fabric 7.1+ version is in progress.<br/>
    In parallel with the Service Fabric runtime upgrade, an application with guest executables or containers is created or upgraded.<br/>
    The Service Fabric runtime upgrade starts rolling back (due to any reason) to a version prior to Service Fabric runtime v7.1.<br/>
    The application fails to activate.<br/>
    To avoid issues when upgrading from a version prior to Service Fabric runtime v7.1 to a Service Fabric 7.1+ runtime version, do not create or upgrade applications with guest executables or containers while the Service Fabric runtime upgrade is in progress.<br/>
    * The simplest mitigation, when possible, is to delete and recreate the application in Service Fabric 7.0.<br/>
    * The other option is to upgrade the application in Service Fabric 7.0 (for example, with a version only change).<br/>
    If the application is stuck in rollback, the rollback has to be first completed before the application can be upgraded again.

<br>


## Upcoming Breaking Changes
* .NET Core runtime LTS 2.1 runtime will go out of support from Aug 21, 2021. Service Fabric releases after that date will drop support for Service Fabric apps running with .NET Core 2.1 runtime. Service Fabric .NET SDK will take a dependency on .Net runtime 3.* features to support Service Fabric .NET Core apps.  This has no impact on Service Fabric .NET Framework SDK.
* .NET 5.0 runtime is reaching end-of-life on May 8, 2022.Service Fabric releases after that date will drop support for Service Fabric applications running with .NET 5.0 runtime.Current applications running on .NET 5.0 runtime will continue to work, but requests for investigations or request for changes will no longer be entertained. Please migrate to using .NET 6.0 version instead.
*  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS reached its 5-year end-of-life window on April 30, 2021.Service Fabric runtime has dropped support for 16.04 LTS, and we recommend moving your clusters and applications to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or 20.04 LTS.Current applications running on it will continue to work, but requests for investigations or requests for change will no longer be entertained. Please migrate to Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 instead.
